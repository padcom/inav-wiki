This version has some significant differences from 1.6.x, please read the release notes carefully and upgrade INAV Configurator available at [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inav-configurator/fmaidjmgkdkpafmbnmigkpdnpdhopgel).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/) and [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/).

## Known bugs

- RTH descent might be too aggressive and don't respect the landing speed on a fixed wing

## CLI parameter renaming

Some CLI parameters are renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:

| Old name               | New name(s)                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mag_hold_rate_limit`  | `heading_hold_rate_limit`                                      |
| `nav_max_speed`        | `nav_auto_speed`                                               |
| `nav_max_climb_rate`   | `nav_auto_climb_rate`                                          |

## Servo mixer parser changed (Very important step for fixed winger)

Angle at min / max has been removed due to it was newer used.

So the servo mixer no longer have does defined, and if you try to copy paste from 1.6.1 release it will not work!

If you copy and paste old value like this you will get parse error:

``# servo 3 1070 1950 1500 90 90 -80 -1``

``Parse error``

You will need to remove ``90 90`` So it looks like this:
``servo 3 1070 1950 1500 -80 -1``

Please, **verify** your servo movement after updating to INAV 1.7

## Airplane autotune

AUTOTUNE mode is a flight mode that acts on top of normal ANGLE/HORIZON/ACRO mode and uses changes in flight attitude input by the pilot to learn the tuning values for roll, pitch and yaw tuning. Please read the [AUTOTUNE manual](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/development/docs/Autotune%20-%20fixedwing.md) carefully before proceeding.

WARNING: You may find the plane is quite sluggish when you first enter AUTOTUNE. You will find that as the tune progresses this will get better. Make sure your flight area has plenty of room for slow large-radius turns.

## Heading Hold flight mode

This flight mode replaces `MAG` and `HEADING LOCK` modes. It affects only yaw axis and can be enabled together with any other flight mode. It helps to maintain current heading without pilots input and can be used with and without magnetometer support. When yaw stick is neutral position, Heading Hold mode tries to keep heading (azimuth if compass sensor is available) at a defined direction. When pilot moves yaw stick, Heading Hold is temporary disabled and is waiting for a new setpoint.

Heading hold only uses yaw control (rudder) so it won't work on a flying wing which has no rudder.

## New boards

- KROOZX board
- BEEROTORF4 board
- ANYFCF7 board

## New features

- Sonar is back enabled with proper hardware detection. Not recommended to be used for flight yet.
- Support for MS5607 baro sensor
- Support for Spansion S25FL116 SPI memory chip
- Flaperon support moved to mixer code. Can be configured for custom airplane mix as separate flaps now
- Enable airplane setups for Sparky board
- Rename MAG mode to Heading Hold mode and allow to operate without compass
- Fixed-wing autotune
- Preliminary support for analog airspeed sensor. No boards support this currently.
- MAVLink made bidirectional. Limited subset of waypoints is supported via QGroundControl and similar software
- Add support for more baud rates (1200 to 921600)
- Add `noreboot` option to `defaults` CLI command. `defaults noreboot` will reset board to defaults but won't reboot the board to allow you to apply configuration right away.
- Remove failsafe channel fallback. Now receiver channel values are always received, but in case of signal loss - not used.
- Enable SoftSerial feature for AIRHEROF3
- HoTT telemetry refactoring
- BLHeli 4wif catch up with Betaflight
- Log last disarm reason to blackbox, report via LTM
- Improve run-time calibration to be faster and more accurate
- Initial cut on coordinated turn code for airplanes. `TURN ASSIST` flight mode will automatically apply rudder and elevator when commanding an aileron-only banked turn.

## Bugs fixed

- Fix incorrect handling of `beeper -ON_USB`
- Fixed speed limitation by `nav_max_speed` enforced even in manual flying
- Fix HMC5883L detection and initialisation in presence of magnetic fields
- Fix broken MPU6500 detection and init
- Fix a bug with falling out of the sky when loosing GPS in FAILSAFE RTH. Now will use SET-THR (landing) as a backup in case RTH is aborted during failsafe.
- Make LTM send X-Frame even for targets w/o GPS
- Allow FAILSAFE to override PASSTHROUGH mode. Fix a bug with failsafe not engaging when plane is in PASSTHROUGH.
- Fix a bug with FAILSAFE locking pilot out of control when board is disarmed by timeout.
- Fix non-working IBUS receiver w/o telemetry
- Fix option to use more motor outputs than are physically available (might cause board to crash)
- Limit RC command processing rate. Fix a bug with stick combos being processed at extreme rate on some receivers
- Custom current metter scale for OmnibusF4 Pro. Fix a bug with incorrect current sensor readings.
- Avoid target clash between PPM and motor output on REVO target. Fix a bug with OneShot125 and PPM being incompatible.
- Fix a bug when airplane althold was not working w/o GPS (baro only)
