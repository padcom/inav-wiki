# Rotation rates conversion

## Rotation rates in MultiWii/Baseflight/Cleanflight

MultiWii/Baseflight/Cleanflight uses arbitrary combination of `rc_rate` and axis rate to determine maximum rotation speed in degrees per second [dps]. By default, `rc_rate` is equal 90 [0,9] for ROLL and PITCH and 100 [1,0] for YAW. Mind that ***rc_rate*** for YAW is hardcoded and can not be changed!!

With default `rc_rate` values, old rates can be converted to maximum rotation speed at full stick deflection using following table:

> To simplify, we assume that `rc_rate` is equal 100 to match ROLL, PITCH and YAW. RC Rate scaling is linear, so to compute rotation on rc_rate 90, divide by 100 and multiply by 90.


| Rate | Rate in Configurator | Rotation speed [dps] |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0 | 0,00 | 200dps |
| 10 | 0,10 | 300dps |
| 20 | 0,20 | 400dps |
| 30 | 0,30 | 500dps |
| 40 | 0,40 | 600dps |
| 50 | 0,50 | 700dps |

This can be computed using following equation:

` rotation_in_dps = (rate + 20) * 10`

## Rotation rates in INAV 1.2

INAV 1.2 changes how rates (rotation speed at maximum stick deflection) is stored. Instead of arbitrary combination of `rc_rate` and axis rate, INAV stores rates as `rate_in_dps / 10`. Also `rc_rate`, as not needed, is removed.

| Rate | Rate in Configurator | Rotation speed [dps] |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0 | 0,00 | invalid |
| 9 | 0,09 | 90dps |
| 10 | 0,10 | 100dps |
| 20 | 0,20 | 200dps |
| 40 | 0,40 | 400dps |
| 50 | 0,50 | 500dps |

Latest INAV Configurator detects INAV 1.2 and allows to enter rates scaled to degrees per second

| Old Rate | INAV 1.2 New Rate |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 0 | 20 |
| 10 | 30 |
