Please read the release notes carefully and upgrade [INAV Configurator application](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/1.9.0).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/), [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/) and a number of supporters on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/inavflight).

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

New parameters have been introduced. Some CLI parameters were renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:

| Name               | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `osd_stats_energy_unit` |  |
| `bat_capacity_unit` |  |
| `smartport_fuel_unit` |  |
| `rangefinder_median_filter` |  |
| `baro_median_filter` |  |
| `failsafe_lights` |  |
| `failsafe_lights_flash_period` |  |
| `failsafe_lights_flash_on_time` |  |
| `battery_capacity` |  |
| `battery_capacity_warning` |  |
| `battery_capacity_critical` |  |
| `battery_capacity_unit` |  |
| `manual_rc_expo` |  |
| `manual_rc_yaw_expo` |  |
| `manual_pitch_rate` |  |
| `manual_yaw_rate` |  |
| `gps_ublox_use_galileo` | Enable use of Galileo satellites. This is at the expense of other regional constellations, so benefit may also be regional. Requires M8N and Ublox firmware 3.x (or later) [OFF/ON]. Default is OFF |
| `smartport_fuel_unit` |  |
| `osd_stats_energy_unit` |  |
| `osd_main_voltage_decimals` |  |
| `osd_wh_drawn_pos` |  |
| `osd_bat_remaining_capacity_pos` |  |
| `osd_bat_remaining_percent_pos` |  |
| `osd_efficiency_mah_pos` |  |
| `osd_efficiency_wh_pos` |  |
| `display_force_sw_blink` |  |
| `mag_to_use` | Allow to chose between built-in and external compass sensor if they are connected to separate buses. Currently only for REVO target |
| `nav_fw_launch_min_time` | Allow launch mode to execute at least this time (ms) and ignore stick movements |
| `nav_fw_launch_max_altitude` | Altitude at which LAUNCH mode will be turned off and regular flight mode will take over |
