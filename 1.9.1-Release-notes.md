Please read the release notes carefully and upgrade [INAV Configurator application](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/1.9.3).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/), [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/) and a number of supporters on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/inavflight).

## WARNINGS

* comparing to INAV 1.8 and below, scaling of `nav_mc_vel_xy_p` has been lowered by a factor of 5. Previous default was `200`, current default is `40`. When restoring configuration from INAV 1.8, divide `nav_mc_vel_xy_p` by **5**. The default value from INAV 1.9 (and a 1.9 setting that works for your machine) can be used without any change in 1.9.1. _Do not restore blindly from backup!_

## Known bugs

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

| Name               | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fw_tpa_time_constant ` | TPA smoothing and delay time constant to reflect non-instant speed/throttle response of the plane. Planes with low thrust/weight ratio generally need higher time constant. Default is zero for compatibility with old setups |

## New boards

* MATEKF405-WING (MATEKF405SE target)
* AIRBOT ASGARD32 F4
* AIRBOT FIREWORKS V2
* AIRBOT OMNIBUS F7 NXT

## New features

* Add MSP message for reading air speed ([@shellixyz], [#2853])
* Add trip distance element to OSD ([@shellixyz], [#2887])
* Add FPort support ([@fiam], [#2815])
* TPA smoothing and delayed response of throttle-based TPA ([@digitalentity], [#2966])

## Improvements

* Bulk gyro/acc reads for better performance ([@digitalentity], [#2846])
* Save almost 7kB of RAM by reworking CMS  ([@fiam], [#2881])
* Quaternion IMU conversion ([@digitalentity], [#2894])
* Current calculation is now more precise ([@shellixyz], [#2941])
* Gyro sync has been deprecated ([@digitalentity], [#2958])

## Bugfixes

* Fix flash overflow on F7 targets due to usage of flash_split ([@digitalentity], [#2535])
* Fix ESC double initialization ([@shellixyz], [#2884])
* Make FS mode take priority over any other modes in OSD display ([@fiam], [#2899])
* Fix bug in MPU6500 accelerometer detection ([@digitalentity], [#2930])
* Fix current not being correctly logged into BlackBox ([@shellixyz], [#2940])
