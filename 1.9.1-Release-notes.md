Please read the release notes carefully and upgrade [INAV Configurator application](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/1.9.3).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/), [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/) and a number of supporters on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/inavflight).

## WARNINGS

* comparing to INAV 1.8 and below, scaling of `nav_mc_vel_xy_p` has been lowered by a factor of 5. Previous default was `200`, current default is `40`. When restoring configuration from INAV 1.8, divide `nav_mc_vel_xy_p` by **5**. Value from INAV 1.9 can be used without any change. _Do not restore blindly from backup!_
