Please read the release notes carefully and upgrade [INAV Configurator application](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/1.9.3).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/), [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/) and a number of supporters on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/inavflight).

## WARNINGS

* comparing to INAV 1.8 and below, scaling of `nav_mc_vel_xy_p` has been lowered by a factor of 5. Previous default was `200`, current default is `40`. When restoring configuration from INAV 1.8, divide `nav_mc_vel_xy_p` by **5**. The default value from INAV 1.9 (and a 1.9 setting that works for your machine) can be used without any change in 1.9.1. _Do not restore blindly from backup!_

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

| Name               | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `align_mag_roll` |  Set the external mag alignment on the roll axis (in 0.1 degree steps). If this value is non-zero, the compass is assumed to be externally mounted and both the board and on-board compass alignent (align_mag) are ignored. See also align_mag_pitch and align_mag_yaw. |
| `align_mag_pitch` | Same as align_mag_roll, but for the pitch axis. |
| `align_mag_yaw` | Same as align_mag_roll, but for the yaw axis. |
| `fw_tpa_time_constant ` | TPA smoothing and delay time constant to reflect non-instant speed/throttle response of the plane. Planes with low thrust/weight ratio generally need higher time constant. Default is zero for compatibility with old setups |
| `report_cell_voltage`  | Makes telemetry in all protocols send the average cell voltage rather than full battery voltage. Replaces `frsky_vfas_cell_voltage` with the same semantics. |
| `serialrx_inverted`  | Reverse the serial inversion of the serial RX protocol. When this value is OFF, each protocol will use its default signal. ON should be used only for custom or hacked receivers. Replaces the `sbus_inversion`, but it's applied to more protocols.  |
| `telemetry_inverted` |  Determines if the telemetry protocol default signal inversion is reversed. This should be OFF in most cases unless a custom or hacked RX is used. Replaces `telemetry_inversion`, which needed per protocol adjustments.

* Fix incorrect PWM output initialization on F7 causing no output on S6 on MatekF722 ([@digitalentity], [#2891])
* Make FS mode take priority over any other modes in OSD display ([@fiam], [#2899])
* Fix bug in MPU6500 accelerometer detection ([@digitalentity], [#2930])
* Fix current not being correctly logged into BlackBox ([@shellixyz], [#2940])
* Fix bug when saving servo params causing the servos not freeze ([@shellixyz], [#2950])
* Fix flaperon mode incorrect direction of flaps ([@shellixyz], [#2961])
