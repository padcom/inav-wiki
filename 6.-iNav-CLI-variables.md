Cleanflight CLI variables related to navigation features  

All iNAV calculations are done in cm, cm/s and cm/s^2.  
  
_As for CLI, here are some useful commands:_  
 _"help" will list available commands._  
 _"dump" will list all settings and what value you have._  
 _"get rth" will list all settings with the word "rth" in them._  
 _"set nav_rth_altitude = 300" to change this setting to 300 (centimeters)._  
 _"save" to save it permanently and reboot your flight controller, remember to do this or your setting changes will be lost!_  

The iNav CLI variables are explained in the [iNav cli variables documentation](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Cli.md)
