## Known bugs


## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

New parameters have been introduced. Some CLI parameters were renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:

| Old name               | New name(s)                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `old_setting` | `new_setting`                                      |
| `feature RX_*` | RX type definition as been moved from a `FEATURE` to a setting `receiver_type`, with values of `NONE`, `PWM`, `PPM`, `SERIAL`, `MSP`, `SPI`. |
| - | `totally_new_setting`                                      |
