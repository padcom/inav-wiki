## Known bugs


## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

New parameters have been introduced. Some CLI parameters were renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:

| Old name               | New name(s)                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `old_setting` | `new_setting`                                      |
| `feature RX_*` | RX type definition as been moved from a `FEATURE` to a setting `receiver_type`, with values of `NONE`, `PWM`, `PPM`, `SERIAL`, `MSP`, `SPI`. |
| - | `totally_new_setting`                                      |

## New boards

* [Board](https://link.com)
* Omnibus F4 Pro Corner
* DYS F4 Pro
* Matek F405 OSD. This requires slightly different firmware to the (also supported) Matek F405 AIO. Please see the baord documentation.

## Discontinued boards

- CC3D
- NAZE (all revisions)

## New features

* SmartAudio and Trump VTX support. Band, channel and transmitter power can be changed from CMS
* RC channels naming simplification. `AUX 1` renamed to `CH 5`, `AUX 2` to `CH 6` and so on. This means that restoring old `map` settings from the CLI will not work, for example TAER1234 is now TAER5678. The Configurator handles this transparently.
* `current_meter_offset` can be negative
* Automated navigation modes (RTH and WP) are overriding MOTOR_STOP. Regardless of user throttle stick position motors would always be running
