Please read the release notes carefully and upgrade INAV Configurator available at [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inav-configurator/fmaidjmgkdkpafmbnmigkpdnpdhopgel).

INAV is and will remain open-source and free, but you are more than welcome to [support the development](https://inavflight.github.io/supporting-inav/). 

This release was supported by our awesome sponsors [CarbonBird.com](http://www.CarbonBird.com), [Airbot](http://shop.myairbot.com/) and [ADPM Drones](http://www.adpm.pro/).

## Known bugs

- please report bugs on issue tracker

## CLI parameter renaming / new parameters

New parameters have been introduced. Some CLI parameters were renamed to support new features or to better reflect their meaning:

| Old name               | New name(s)                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| new parameter  | `fw_turn_assist_yaw_gain`                                      |

## Changed servo mixer output scaling

Servo speed now works as expected (defined in pwm_us per second). Servo mixer now does actual scaling between min/max values which allows asymmetric servo travel (useful on airplanes).

WARNING: Prevois PID tuning may be irrelevant now on some airplane setups (especially flying wings). Use caution and verify that tuning is good.

## New boards

- [MATEKF405 board](http://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=f405-osd)
- [SPRACINGF3 NEO board](http://seriouslypro.com/spracingf3neo) - not well tested, use caution
- BEEROTORF4 target - not well tested, use cation
- OMNIBUSF4V3 target
- Alienflight F7 board


## New features

- Improved landing procedure for airplanes. Still acts more like a controlled crash, but does the touchdown in a much more gentle way now.
- eLeReS support for KFC board
- Enable GPS on LUX target
- Flight statistics (odometer) - a feature to accumulate total flight hours and distance
- Added support for baro-less ANYFC F7 board
- Add servo support for LUX and COLIBRI_RACE targets
- User-definable ADC channel mapping to ADC functions
- Improved airspeed calculations to be usable for PID correction (changed to IAS instead of CAS/TAS)
- Adds sdcard_detect_inverted setting to make detection configurable
- Servo mixer rework to allow real output scaling
- Accelerometer notch filter (disabled by default)
- Add compass calibration start beep
- Support for analog airspeed sensor, enabled on more targets now
- Added craft name to CLI dump

## Bugs fixed

- Fixed altitude icon on OSD
- Bug with bounce-back when doing slow yaw corrections with HEADING_HOLD enabled
- More eavenly spread the CPU load of OSD update to make horizon drift issue less evident
- Fix timer mapping for OMNIBUSF4PRO target - now usable on airplane
- Fix PPM input on ANYFC F7
- Better default configuration for FALCORE drone
- Fix a bug with PPM IN incompatible with OS125 and above
- Fix CC3D motor pwm rate bound to 400hz
