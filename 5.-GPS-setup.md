iNav supports ublox GPS units.

Tested and recommended GPS are M8N versions (e.g. [Ublox NEO-M8N](http://www.banggood.com/Ublox-NEO-M8N-Flight-Controller-GPS-with-Protective-Shell-for-PIX-PX4-Pixhawk-p-1005394.html?p=ZL241728738232015106) and [Beitian BN-880](http://www.banggood.com/UBLOX-NEO-M8N-BN-880-Flight-Control-GPS-Module-Dual-Module-Compass-p-971082.html?p=ZL241728738232015106) )
But both M6N and M7N should work. Most GPS modules have a built in magnetometer (compass), but there are also some available without e.g. [Beitian BN-180](http://www.banggood.com/Beitian-BN-180-Flight-Control-GPS-Module-Dule-Module-without-Compass-p-1040322.html?p=ZL241728738232015106). 

With default settings iNav will configure the GPS automatically, there is no need for configuring it manually using software like u-center. Nevertheless you have to configure your FC with iNav to receive the GPS signals.

If you want to use the external magnetometer (built in in your GPS) and you have a FC with the same magnetometer (HMC5883L is very common), you have to disable it physically on your FC: remove chip from board or cut a trace. You can't use two identical chips/magnetometers on the same I2C bus.  
Otherwise just use the internal FC magnetometer, but keep aware of magnetic interference (not recommended).
##Getting started
- Physically connect your GPS to your FC using UART or softserial. Connect RX from GPS to TX on FC, TX from GPS to RX on FC
- If you use the GPS built in magnetometer, connect the magnetometer to I2C ports (SCL/SDA)
- Activate GPS in the ports tab in cleanflight/iNav configurator and set it to 57600 using UART or 19200 using softserial (on your chosen port)
- Activate GPS in the configuration tab, set it to ublox and set the magnetic declination. The magnetic declination of your specific location can be found here: www.magnetic-declination.com  
If your magnetic declination readings are e.g. +3° 34', the value entered in iNav is 3,34. 
- Calibrate your compass according to [compass calibration](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/4.-Sensor-calibration#compass-calibration)

## SBAS

When using a UBLOX GPS the SBAS mode can be configured using `gps_sbas_mode`.

The default is AUTO.

| Value    | Region        |
| -------- | ------------- |
| AUTO     | Global        |
| EGNOS    | Europe        |
| WAAS     | North America |
| MSAS     | Asia          |
| GAGAN    | India         |

If you use a regional specific setting you may achieve a faster GPS lock than using AUTO.

This setting only works when `gps_auto_config= ON`


## Issues
- No GPS lock: often due to electric noise from flight controller or other equipment such as 1.2ghz video TX. Try getting the GPS as far away as possible from electric noise emitting parts as the FC, ESC´s or power cables. Placing the GPS on a mast is also a common way, you can further try shielding with aluminum or copper foil. Don´t place the GPS inside the frame.
- "Toilet bowling": in the beginning the copter holds its position and then starts to make bigger and bigger circles, you probably have your magnetometer not calibrated correctly or it’s interfered from the magnetic field of your power lines or the beeper.
If you are using your FC onboard mag, try to place the the FC as far away as possible from the magnetic interference causing parts e.g. mounting it on/under the top plate on small racers.
