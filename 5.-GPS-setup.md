iNav in supports Ublox, DJI NAZA, NMEA, multiwii's i2c-nav board and MultiWiiCopter's i2c-gps modules

Tested and confirming working protocols are Ublox and DJI NAZA


Recommended GPS are M8N versions (e.g. [Ublox NEO-M8N](http://www.banggood.com/Ublox-NEO-M8N-Flight-Controller-GPS-with-Protective-Shell-for-PIX-PX4-Pixhawk-p-1005394.html?p=ZL241728738232015106) and [Beitian BN-880](http://www.banggood.com/UBLOX-NEO-M8N-BN-880-Flight-Control-GPS-Module-Dual-Module-Compass-p-971082.html?p=ZL241728738232015106) )
Older versions as M6N and M7N also work, but the new M8N is far superior. Most GPS modules have a built in magnetometer (compass), but there are also some available without e.g. [Beitian BN-180](http://www.banggood.com/Beitian-BN-180-Flight-Control-GPS-Module-Dule-Module-without-Compass-p-1040322.html?p=ZL241728738232015106). 

With default settings iNav will configure the GPS automatically, **there is no need for configuring it manually** using software like u-center. Nevertheless you have to configure your FC with iNav to receive the GPS signals.

If you want to use the external magnetometer (built in in your GPS) and you have a FC with the same magnetometer (HMC5883L is very common), you have to disable it physically on your FC: remove chip from board or cut a trace. You can't use two identical chips/magnetometers on the same I2C bus. (When using DJI NAZA gps this is not true, DJI NAZA sends compass over serial and does not use the I2C bus)

Otherwise just use the internal FC magnetometer, but keep aware of magnetic interference (not recommended).

##Getting started with Ublox GPS
- Physically connect your GPS to your FC using UART or softserial. Connect RX from GPS to TX on FC, TX from GPS to RX on FC
- If you use the GPS built in magnetometer, connect the magnetometer to I2C ports (SCL/SDA)
- Activate GPS in the ports tab in cleanflight/iNav configurator and set it to 57600 using UART or 19200 using softserial (on your chosen port)
- Activate GPS in the configuration tab, set it to ublox and set the magnetic declination. The magnetic declination of your specific location can be found here: www.magnetic-declination.com. 
If your magnetic declination readings are e.g. +3° 34', the value entered in iNav is 3,34. 
- Calibrate your compass according to [compass calibration](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/4.-Sensor-calibration#compass-calibration)
- Keep in mind to change the magnetic declination when you change your location, although +-0,05 should´nt make a big difference.  

##Getting started with DJI NAZA GPS
- Physically connect your GPS to your FC using UART. Connect RX from GPS to TX on FC, TX from GPS to RX on FC
- Activate GPS in the ports tab in cleanflight/iNav configurator and set it to 115 200 on correct UART
- Type this in CLI

`feature GPS`

`set gps_provider = NAZA`

`set align_mag = CW180FLIP`

`set mag_hardware = 4`

- Configure your magnetic declination of your specific location can be found here: www.magnetic-declination.com. 
If your magnetic declination readings are e.g. +3° 34', the value entered in iNav is 3,34. 
- Calibrate your compass according to [compass calibration](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/4.-Sensor-calibration#compass-calibration)


Thats it!


## SBAS

When using a UBLOX GPS the SBAS mode can be configured using `gps_sbas_mode`.

The default is AUTO.

| Value    | Region        |
| -------- | ------------- |
| AUTO     | Global        |
| EGNOS    | Europe        |
| WAAS     | North America |
| MSAS     | Asia          |
| GAGAN    | India         |
| NONE     | NONE         |

If you use a regional specific setting you may achieve a faster GPS lock than using AUTO, but keep in mind to change it if you change your location for holidays etc.

This setting only works when `gps_auto_config= ON`

## UBlox GPS manual configuration

Use ublox u-center and connect your GPS to your computer.  The CLI `gpspassthrough` command may be of use if you do not have a spare USART to USB adapter for direct GPS connection. With passthrough it is possible to connect your FC as usual via micro-USB to USB. If you do so, connect your FC, open cleanflight/iNav configurator, open the CLI tab, type "gpspassthrough", disconnect cleanflight/iNav configurator. Now you are able to configure the GPS via u-center, connect to the specific com port using 115200 as baudrate.

Note that many boards will not provide +5V from USB to the GPS module, such as the SPRacingF3; if you are using `gpspassthrough` you may need to connect a BEC to the controller if your board permits it, or use a standalone UART adapter. Check your board documentation to see if your GPS port is powered from USB.

Display the Packet Console (so you can see what messages your receiver is sending to your computer).

Display the Configation View.

Navigate to CFG (Configuration)

Select `Revert to default configuration`.
Click `Send`.

At this point you might need to disconnect and reconnect at the default baudrate - probably 9600 baud.

Navigate to PRT (Ports)

Set `Target` to `1 - Uart 1`
Set `Protocol In` to `0+1+2`
Set `Protocol Out` to `0+1`
Set `Buadrate` to `57600`  
Press `Send`

This will immediatly "break" communication to the GPS. Since you haven't saved the new baudrate setting to the non-volatile memory you need to change the baudrate you communicate to the GPS without resetting the GPS. So `Disconnect`, Change baud rate to match, then `Connect`. 

Click on `PRT` in the Configuration view again and inspect the packet console to make sure messages are being sent and acknowledged.

Next, to ensure the FC doesn't waste time processing unneeded messages, click on `MSG` and enable the following on UART1 alone with a rate of 1. When changing message target and rates remember to click `Send` after changing each message.:

    NAV-POSLLH
    NAV-DOP
    NAV-SOL
    NAV-VELNED
    NAV-TIMEUTC

Enable the following on UART1 with a rate of 5, to reduce bandwidth and load on the FC.

    NAV-SVINFO

All other message types should be disabled.

Next change the global update rate, click `Rate (Rates)` in the Configuration view.

Set `Measurement period` to `100` ms.
Set `Navigation rate` to `1`.
Click `Send`.

This will cause the GPS receive to send the require messages out 10 times a second.  If your GPS receiver cannot be set to use `100`ms try `200`ms (5hz) - this is less precise, but on some GPS modules with simultaneously used satellite reception it is not possible to go lower.

Next change the mode, click `NAV5 (Navigation 5)` in the Configuration View.

Set to `Dynamic Model` to `Airborne<1G` and click `Send`.

Next change the SBAS settings.  Click `SBAS (SBAS Settings)` in the Configuration View.

Set `Subsystem` to `Enabled`.
Set `PRN Codes` to `Auto-Scan`.
Click `Send`.

Finally, we need to save the configuration.

Click `CFG (Configuration` in the Configuration View.

Select `Save current configuration` and click `Send`.

## Issues
- No GPS lock: often due to electric noise from flight controller or other equipment such as 1.2ghz video TX. Try getting the GPS as far away as possible from electric noise emitting parts as the FC, ESC´s or power cables. Placing the GPS on a mast is also a common way, you can further try shielding with aluminum or copper foil. Don´t place the GPS inside the frame.
- "Toilet bowling": in the beginning the copter holds its position and then starts to make bigger and bigger circles, you probably have your magnetometer not calibrated correctly or it’s interfered from the magnetic field of your power lines or the beeper.
If you are using your FC onboard mag, try to place the the FC as far away as possible from the magnetic interference causing parts e.g. mounting it on/under the top plate on small racers.
