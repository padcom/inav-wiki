### Getting started

## Where to download?!
Download the *.hex file for your flight controller from the [latest stable iNav release page](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases/latest) and use the chrome app [Cleanflight Configurator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cleanflight-configurator/enacoimjcgeinfnnnpajinjgmkahmfgb) to flash it. You can also buy the android app [Cleanflight flasher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eziosoft.cleanflight_flasher) to directly download newest version and flash.

You can also install in Chrome the [INAV Configurator](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator), but you will have to install it in a [Alternative way](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator#alternative-way). This is a better option, as you can download the new releases directly from it. INAV Configurator, which is designed for INAV, has some differences and improvements over Cleanflight configurator.

Go through the index on the right side to find useful information.

### Hardware needed for GPS assisted modes.

* Multirotors: GPS, magnetometer, barometer.
* Fixed wings: GPS. (Can also use magnetometer and barometer but not needed.)


### Notes / Common issues

* iNav has removed all other telemetry options when using Naze32 targets but LTM in official builds, if you need let's say Frsky telemetry you need to compile your own. See link. Eg. F3 board, which have more memory, have Frsky included.

* iNav does not show "GPS Signal Strength" for each satellite in the Cleanflight configurator, instead only the first one is used to show [HDOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision_%28GPS%29)

* iNav has only one PID controller called fp-pid. This is a modified version of luxfloat, and will show up as luxfloat in cleanflight configurator.

* iNav has extra safety feature that prevents you from arming your aircraft if certain condition are met, or not met. This is controlled by CLI variable "Nav_extra_arming_safety" which is default turned on.

1. No valid GPS lock.
1. Navigation modes are turned on while trying to arm.


* iNav has other GPS modes than cleanflight, or names them differently. Read [this wiki page](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/7.-Navigation-modes) for how to use them, and combine them to get wanted position hold.

* If your copter is toilet-bowling, which means, in the beginning it holds its position and then starts to make bigger and bigger circles, you probably have your magnetometer not calibrated correctly or itâ€™s seeing the magnetic field of you power lines or the beeper.


**Checklist if you're having issue with something:**

1. Try and look through the wiki regarding the issue you have. You can also search the Wiki.
1. Read the first post [rcgroups Cleanflight iNav thread](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2495732). Also read the last 5 pages in the thread to see if someone else has already mentioned it. Also try and search in the thread.
1. Explain your issue, include CLI dump and blackbox log if you have a logger. Mention what you have tried, and also if it's working as intended in stock Cleanflight.
