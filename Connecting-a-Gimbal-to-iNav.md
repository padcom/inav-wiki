There are two ways of doing this.

1: Using channel forwarding, this is to controll pitch and yaw on a self-stabilation gimbal like [this](http://www.banggood.com/Upgrade-Debugging-Edition-JIYI-FPV-G3-3D-3-Axis-Gimbal-For-Gopro-Hero3-3-Hero4-Aerial-Photography-p-1031482.html?rmmds=search) that has its own board with sensor to stabilize the gimbal itself.

2: Using servo_tilt to let the flight controller do the stabiliation itself. It is example when using two servos to stabilize and camera. Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_RLdZwAlc&t=81s)
