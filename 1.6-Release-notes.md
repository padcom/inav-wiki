## New failsafe system

Failsafe Stage 1 is completely gone now, `rxfail` command is deprecated. Everything that is called "FAILSAFE" is now related to actual failsafe procedure. Failsafe FEATURE is deprecated - failsafe system is always functional and ready to catch you.

New "NONE" failsafe procedure is introduced to allow completely ignoring RC link loss. Be warned that you are no longer protected from flying out of range when using this feature.

A bunch of new parameters allow "LAND" procedure to work on fixed-wing aircraft as well. Failsafe will now command a slight dive, bank and yaw to bring the airplane down nicely in case of link loss. Previous behavior was to maintain level flight and fly-away.

New parameter `rx_nosignal_throttle` defines how throttle channel will behave in case of link loss. Options are DROP and HOLD. Roll, Pitch and Yaw channels are centered and this behavior can't be changed anymore. This behavior is only applied for a small amount of time before FAILSAFE kicks in and starts doing something smart.

New parameter `failsafe_stick_threshold` will allow you to keep FAILSAFE active even if the RC link is restored. You will have to move your sticks more than `failsafe_stick_threshold` to regain control. This is done to allow nice return-to-home in case of signal loss.

## New PIFF controller for fixed-wing aircraft

Introducing new Proportional + Integral + Feed Forward controller for airplanes. It's more suitable for airplanes due to the nature of control they are using. It also puts less stress on servos. D-term in Configurator will now control Feed-Forward gain which passes angular rate target directly to servos bypassing closed loop gyroscope stabilisation. Use caution - too high Feed-Forward gain may cause violent oscillations in ANGLE mode.

## Airplane launch mode improvements

It's now possible to specify idle throttle for pre-launch (`nav_fw_launch_idle_thr`) and time to gradually increase throttle after launch is detected (`nav_fw_launch_spinup_time`). This allows to have motor spinning even when using MOTOR_STOP feature and will put less stress on ESCs by allowing them to spin up the motor to launch throttle gradually instead of requesting an instantenious throttle change.


## RTH sanity checking

Misconfigured or malfunctioning compass can confuse the firmware in such a way that it won't realize where North direction is. This may cause the machine to fly in wrong direction when i.e. doing an RTH and fly away instead of returning to home.

Another case is flying in extremely strong wind which machine is unable to fight. In such case RTH will attempt to bring machine home but will never succeed and UAV will be blown away.

RTH sanity checking feature will notice if distance to home is increasing during RTH and once amount of increase exceeds a certain threshold defined by `nav_rth_abort_threshold` CLI parameter instead of continuing RTH machine will enter emergency landing, self-level and go down safely. Default threshold is set to 500m which is safe enough for both multirotor machines and airplanes.

## New boards

- NAZE target is split to actual `NAZE` and `AIRHERO32` for MWC AirHero32 board
- PIXRACER board initial support. Experimental - many features are not yet functional
- OMNIBUS F4 SD target
- F4BY target

## New features

- Initial support for STM32F7 boards. More CPU power for better performance
- Full support of SoftSerial ports on F4-based boards
- Gyro/D-term notch filter and D-term setpoint weight (as in Betaflight)
- TBS Crossfire native radio protocol and telemetry (CRSF)
- Firmware support for better UI for 6-point calibration
- Make max total PID output configurable, default limit reduced to 500 for better stability
- Inversion control for S.Bus - now it's possible to have non-inverted S.Bus (for OpenLRS compatibility)
- Airplane mixers defaults to use two motor outputs now
- PASSTHRU mode will now allow to mix sticks into motors for differential thrust support
- More authority for Altitude Hold PIDs. Please revisit ALT and VEL PIDs if aircraft misbehaves.
- Two banks of PIDs for Fixed-wing and Multirotor crafts. A small step towards VTOL support
- Configurable timeout for compass calibration (instead of hard-coded 30 seconds)
- When using new Configurator the Altitude graph in Sensor tab will now show both estimated altitude and raw BARO readings
- Extremely long flights are now possible on F3/F4/F7 targets. On F1 the system time will overflow at 1 hour, 11 minutes, 35 seconds and may cause some systems to malfunction (failsafe is one of suspects). Use caution when testing this feature.

## Bugs fixed

- Telemetry and MSP data corruption on F1 (UART1 only) and F4 (all UARTs) targets
- Motor 6 output on REVO is now functional
- Occasional reboot of the board when bluetooth module is disconnected
- Rare complete stall of attitude/navigation system due to invalid gyro/acceleration data
- LED STRIP was blinking out one extra satellite when signalling GPS fix
- `3d_deadband_throttle` setting was handled incorrectly by MSP which caused corruption
- iBUS telemetry not functional bug
