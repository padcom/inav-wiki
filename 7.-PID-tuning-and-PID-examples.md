## PID tuning

Do it one step at a time. - zero out I and D and tune P, then add D, then add I to flight drift. Fine-tune using blackbox or HD camera. 

//TODO write it better

Caution: The values set in CLI are displayed (and input) in a different format in the PID tab of Cleanflight!
 - P-values: factor of 10, e.g. set p_pitch = 55 is displayed 5,5 in the configurator 
 - I-values: factor of 1000, e.g. set i_pitch = 20 is displayed 0.0020 in the configurator 
 - D-values: factor of 1, e.g. set d_pitch = 70 is displayed 70in the configurator

With default PIDs my craft had a strong wobble on the pitch axces. This is probably because much of the weight of the craft is at the front from the front mounted gimbal, and at the back from the battery. To fix this i had to tune my pids a lot, and they are now a lot higher than stock. All the other inav settings work great with stock values after tuning the pids of the craft.
