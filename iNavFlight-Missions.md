# Overview

iNav supports autonomous flight using waypoints. In order to use this capability, it is also necessary to utilise and configure some supporting technologies, including:

* A GCS (Ground Control Station). The GCS will typically provide functions to create waypoint (WP) missions, upload WP missions to the flight controller (FC), validate the mission, execute the mission and log the mission;
* Telemetry Hardware. In order to transfer the mission to the FC and monitor the mission in real time during mission execution it is necessary to install and configure a telemetry system between the GCS and the multicopter.

This wiki topic describes the software currently available and some of the telemetry options. 

# Ground Control Stations

Currently there are two GCS applications widely used for iNav mission management, ezgui <http://ez-gui.com/> (Android) and mwp <https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools> (Linux). In future, other options may become available, particularly if the MAVLink protocol becomes supported by iNav.
