If it helps anyone that visited this blank page I am using the spare right angle 8 way header I got with naze board (i used straight one to solder to board). I have soldered together all the +ve pins, -ve pins and plug all the servos and esc plug into that to distribute power. (All signal wires removed and plugged into naze which along with receiver and osd is powered by seperate 5v bec)
