# 1. Setting up the hardware

## Vibration dampening
iNav firmware is using inertial navigation system (INS), this means that firmware is dependant on ways of accurately measuring acceleration. Vibration is essentially a periodic acceleration and will confuse the INS up to the total inability to do its job correctly. There are two ways of fighting vibraton - balancing props and motors and vibration dampening. If applied together these two methods greatly improve INS performace.
