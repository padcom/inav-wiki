INAV is a fork of cleanflight with focus upon GPS features for both airplanes & multirotors.

iNav currently supports RTH (_Return To Home_) with a predefined climb height, position hold, [[waypoints|iNavFlight Missions]], "follow-me" and many more features. 

iNav has many settings that are different than cleanflight, and simply restoring settings from older cleanflight won't work.

**As such it is ABSOLUTELY mandatory to read these pages:**

- [Getting started with iNav](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Getting-started-with-iNav)

- [Sensor calibration](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Sensor-calibration)

- [Multirotor guide](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Multirotor-guide) if you're going to use it in a multirotor.

- [Fixed wing guide](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Fixed-wing-guide) if you're going to use it in a fixed wing.

- Many flight controller boards are supported. See the [Supported boards](Supported-boards) page.
