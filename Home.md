iNav is a fork of cleanflight with focus on GPS features.
It currently supports position hold, RTH with predefined climb height, waypoints and follow-me. Both with airplanes & multirotors.

iNav have some settings that are different than stock cleanflight, and simply restoring settings from older cleanflight won't work.

It is ABSOLUTELY mandatory to read these pages.
