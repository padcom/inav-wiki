INAV is a fork of cleanflight with focus on GPS features.
It currently supports position hold, RTH with predefined climb height, [[waypoints|iNavFlight Missions]] and follow-me. Both with airplanes & multirotors.

INAV have some settings that are different than stock cleanflight, and simply restoring settings from older cleanflight won't work.
